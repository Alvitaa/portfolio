# Juan Alva's Portfolio

This is the repository for the React + Vite + Tailwind CSS app of my Portfolio. This portfolio is designed in such a way that evokes the soul of a subway train station.

Also this web showcases some of my personal and academic projects i've made ever since i started developing with HTML and REACT.

## Live Web
